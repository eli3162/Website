It was a gloomy, shadowed day, when a car came to pick up his [sibling]. As the [transport] came, he tensed, wondering what it was up to, hoping it wouldn’t stop at his house. When it did, his heart skipped a beat. He wondered what it had come for. The [bad people] knocked on the door, and almost as he opened it, they asked, “Where is [sibling]?” When they took [sibling], he was afraid to speak up, do anything, fearing he would be next. 

 

As the [transport] drove away, he wondered, “Should I have done something?” “What could I have done?” As he sat around his room, trying to figure out what to do, not that [sibling] was gone. He vowed to save [sibling] and resurrect his fractured family.   

 

After making my way to the [meetup place], he was confronted by a pair of guards, guarding the entrance of the [meetup place]. When they asked why he was there, he had told them, “I am here to overthrow the the supreme lord!” The guards laughed and let him in. As he entered the stronghold, he immediately felt powerless, as he saw even criminals could muster a lot; how would he be of any help to them? 

 

The guards escorted him into a room; where he met their leader, [leader’s name]. [leader’s name] immediately asked, "What are you here for?” He replied, “To ask for your assistance in a matter.” “What matter?” asked [leader’s name]? “Overriding the the supreme lord” he said nonchalantly. “What can you offer us? All I care about is Time, Money, maybe Skill?” “I have...” But before he could continue, a pair of scouts came rushing into the room, informing Mr. Fight about an imminent attack on the laboratory planned by another gangster group! “Tell them we need to collaborate!” “For now, let's go get geared up!” said Mr. Fight.  

 

After regrouping in a safehouse near the laboratory with the other gang, they were ready to show the supreme lord what they truly were! They stormed the laboratory, and he made it his mission to find his sibling, as the rest of the gangster groups only cared for the valuable resources hidden inside, instead of the hundreds of victims they could save. When he pleaded with the gangsters about rescuing people, few supported him, saying, “Who cares for people, we’re here for the money!” Although he found his sister, he was unable to save the rest of the victims!
